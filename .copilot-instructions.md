# Taskboard

Taksboard is a Trello-style task management app built with JS and Supabase. Users register/login,then create projects, view the taskborard for each project, and create / edit / delete tasks on the taskboard. Tasks can be dragged and dropped between columns on the taskboard and reordered within columns. 

## Architecture

Classical client-server app:
 - Front-end: JS app, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
 - Back-end: Supabase 
 - Database: PostgresSQL
 - Authentication: Supabase Auth
 - Build tools: Vite, npm
 - API: Supabase REST API
 - Hosting: Netlify
 - Source code: GitHub

## Modular Design

Use modular code structure, with separate files for different components pages and features. Use ES6 modules to organize the code.

## UI Guidelines
 - Use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla JS for the front-end. 
 - Use Bootstrap components and utilities to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
 - Implement modern responsive UI design with semantic HTML and CSS.
 - Use a consistent color scheme and typography.
 - Use appropriate icons, effects and visual cues to engance usability.

## Pages and navigation
 - Split the app into multiple pages: login, registration, project list, taskboard, admin panel etc.
  - Implement pages as reusable components (HTML, CSS and JS code).
  - Use routing to navigate between pages.
  - Use full URLs like /, /login, /register, /projects, / {id}/takss, /admin etc.


## Backend and Database
 - Use Supabase as the backend and database for the app.
 - Use PostgreSQL as the database with tables for users, projects, tasks etc.
  - Use Supabase Storage for file uploads (e.g. task attachments).
  - When changing the database schema, always use migrations to keep track of changes.
  - After applying migration in Supabase, keep a copy of the migration SQL file in the project repository for reference and version control.


## Authentication and Authorization
 - Use Supabase Auth for user authentication and authorization.
 - Implement RLS policies to restrict access to data based on user roles and permissions.
 - Implement user roles with a separate table in the database: `user_roles` + enum `roles` (e.g. admin, user).
